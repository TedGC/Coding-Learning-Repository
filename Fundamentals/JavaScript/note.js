/**
 * javscript fundamentals and some basic information with regard to how to think
 * and talk within the language of Javascript
 * 
 * Math operators 
 *  
 * modulo operator 
 * 9 % 2 = 1 the remaining number after the calculation operation will come out
 *
 * NaN 
 * a numeric value that represents  something that is not a number
 * the type of it is number but technically not considered as a number due to 
 * the nature of how it's formalized within Javascript
 * 
 * 
 * variables 
 * varialbes are like labels for values
 * we cna store a value and give it a name so that we can:
 * refer back to it later
 * use that value to do stuff
 * or change it later one
 * 
 * 
 * strings 
 * strings are another primitive type in Javascript. They represent text, and must be 
 * wrapped in quotes 
 * 
 * 1. each character has a corresponding index (a positional index)
 * 
 * 
 * String methods
 * methods are built in action we can perform with individual strings
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * arguments
 * some methods accwepts arguments that modify their behavior. think of them as inputs
 * that we can pass in. we pass these arguments inside of the parentheses 
 * 
 * 
 * null 
 * international absence of any value
 * must be assigned
 * 
 * undefined
 * varialbes that do not have an assigned value are undefined 
 * 
 * 
 * math object
 * 
 * contains properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions 
 * 
 * 
 * double equals
 * checks for eqaulity of value, but not equality of type
 * it coerces both values to the same type and then compares them
 * this can lead to some unexpcted results
 * 
 * triple equals
 * checks for equality of value and type 
 * 
 * 
 * object materials and some of stuff to make note of 
 * 
 * property = key + value 
 * 
 * anything that is stored as a key in an object will be converted into 'string'
 * and will be treated as such even when called out using a function or something
 * 
 * 
 * arrays + objects is a very common way of expressing some stuff in Javascript
 * 
 * object synxtax
 * 
 * selector {key : value }
 * 
 * FOR LOOP SYNTAX
 * 
 * for (
 *  [initialExpression];
 *  [condition];
 *  [incrementExpression]
 * )
 * 
 * 
 * arguement is what we pass inside the parentheses when we exectue the function
 * parameter is just the placehoder variable that we define for use inside of
 * our function definition 
 * 
 * RETURN
 * 
 * the return statement ends function execution and specifies the value to be 
 * returned by that function 
 * 
 * 
 * RESTful apis and other functions to communicate with the server
 * 
 * GET /comments - list all comments
 * POST /commnets - Create a new comment 
 * GET / comments/:id - get one comment (using Id)
 * PATCH / comments/:id - update one comment
 * DELETE / comments /:id - destory one comment 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *
